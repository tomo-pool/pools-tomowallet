        please pm <a href="http://t.me/khaihkd">@khaihkd</a> or
        send <a href="mailto:admin@tomopool.com">email</a> with
        your wallet address and pool name.<br></li>
    <li>“Transfer Stake” function is transfer
        your staked amount to another wallet owner. You can use the function to sell
        your staking amount to someone or to move it to your another wallet.<br>
    </li>
    <li>This is not TomoChain’s official
        product, so if there is a UI problem, it’s definitely not related to the
        chain, none of it related to the products of TomoChain.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Stakers in here are receiving rewards in
        a decentralized way, no one is controlling their stake. Please check the
        smart contract code before claiming any thing bad to us.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Yes, sometime there is an issue with
        showing your stake on the UI, and we knew it is not that perfect, and we are
        trying hard to fix it. If you have problems, kindly pm <a href="http://t.me/khaihkd">@khaihkd</a> or
        send <a href="mailto:admin@tomopool.com" >email</a>
    </li>
    <li>We are full-time employers of TomoChain
        and we are sacrificing our family time to develop this project in order for
        stakers to earn more rewards → we all think of stakers.
    </li>
    <li>15% of pool rewards that we take (from
        the contract) is right now not enough for us to pay hardware/cloud fees, but
        we are still running it for the ecosystem, for the stakers.
    </li>
    <li>If you don’t feel confident about the
        pools, go for TomoMaster, which is the standard staking system and it is
        running flawlessly because we spend our full-time to develop it.
    </li>
    <li>50k TOMO stake is candidate deposit on
        pools. If a pool’s stakes decreased to 50k, nobody can unstake until the
        pool resign or got more stakes over 50k. In order for 100% decentralization,
        to resign the pool you stake in, you need to make your vote to resign the
        pool. If 66% of stakes agree, the pool will be resigned. In case the pool
        capacity is less than 60k and if nobody makes votes, the pool can be
        resigned after 10 days.</li>
    <li>If 66% of stakers voted for resign, the
        pool will not be node anymore after 30 days and everybody will be able to
        unstake their votes. If you want to vote for resign; go to your pool, click
        OTHER → Vote Resign.
